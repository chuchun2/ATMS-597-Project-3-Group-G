## Usage
From Dataset 
- Calculate and plot: Cumulative histogram and line at the 95th percentile
Anomalies 
- Calculate and plot the long term mean: 250 hPa (wind vectors and wind speed anomalies), 500 hPa (wind vectors and geopotential height), 850 hPa (temperature, specific humidity and winds), skin temperature, surface wind, total atmospheric column water vapor
- Calculate and plot the extremes: 250 hPa (wind vectors and wind speed anomalies), 500 hPa (wind vectors and geopotential height anomalies), 850 hPa (temperature, specific humidity, and winds anomalies).
